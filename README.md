# MyAnimeList-Stylesheets
 
These are stylesheets I created for personal use on myanimelist.net, a website used to catalog what anime I watch.  


My goal in creating these spreadsheets was to not only remedy the default style's lackluster appearance (see image in folder) but also to create new functionalities and a better navigation system.  I removed the clustered navigation bar at the top of the page and added a streamlined sidebar.  Added functionality includes implementing a package (not created by me) to display covers photos for each anime and adapting the tags section into a larger textbox that can be used to create short reviews.  


I needed to find a way to position the sidebar such that the main table and sidebar would not overlap when zooming in on Mozilla and Opera.  Other challenges included compensating for Edge's inability to render certain boxes with both a border radius, specific position on the page set via a percentage, and dynamic movement.  Further research showed me that this was (and still is, to my knowledge) apparently a known and unfixed glitch in the browser itself.
